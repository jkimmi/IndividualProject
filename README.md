### Abstract
  What can we find about Los Angeles, California's dining prefrences using Yelp's API? 
In 2004, Yelp and Yelp.com were founded by Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons. Located in San Francisco, California, this community-driven review platform helps people worldwide discover the best businesses for their needs. Within three years time, in 2007, Yelp hit the milestone of 1 million reviews. Today, in its almost two-decade existence, the review platform continues to connect businesses and people with a little help of AI integration and other social media platforms.

According to Yelp.com, there are 6.3 million active claimed local business pages and a monthly average of 265 million cumulative reviews. Of the 265 million reviews, as of May 2023, 17% of those reviews are for restaurants, which is the second-highest number of reviews. Surprisingly, home & local services have the highest percentage of reviews, garnering 19%, while nightlife receives the lowest number of reviews, making up only 2% of the 265 million reviews.

Yelp has a very large database. I cannot run or work with such large amount of data so I will specifically look at dining preferences in Los Angeles.
